I'm glad to see I'm so productive in the past few days. There are so many thoughts that I want to do in the future, especially since I just began this blog, so here are some plans:

1. I will finish the confounder article, discussing DAG, exchangeability, and M-bias. 
2. There are many more others we care about in confounding. I can think of strength and residual confounding, but I won't start that in the upcoming few months.
3. So I want to continue the discussion on some traditional biases. We will probably go over some time-related biases that happened in longitudinal studies.
4. I invite some of my cohort to write reflections on the topic they are working on and the methodology challenge. Hopefully, you can see them soon.

I guess this is the plan for now. I need some technical updates to try to let Google index those pages. Therefore, more people are able to visit the site.

This is more like a reminder to me. So once everything is on track, I will delete this post.
