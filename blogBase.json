Many people, especially late at night, can\u2019t help but wonder: if I had made a different choice in the past, what would my present look like?\n\n## Counterfactual reasoning\nIf there\u2019s a chance in the future, we could trace the idea of counterfactuals from philosophy all the way through the historical development of epidemiology. In this essay, however, we focus simply on the basic concept of counterfactual reasoning and how it is applied in epidemiology.\n\nThe term counterfactual isn\u2019t hard to understand. In general, it just refers to an alternative possibility to a given fact. These come as a pair: the fact and its counterfactual. From this concept, one key principle is obvious: **a counterfactual cannot be observed**. And that is essentially the whole point\u2014counterfactuals are not lofty; in fact, we often use them in everyday conversation. For example, many history enthusiasts discuss how history might have changed if a person in the past had not done a certain thing, which is a classic example.\n\nIn the example above, we can also see another feature of counterfactuals: within this framework, we compare **different possible outcomes of the same event**, while keeping everything else unchanged. If we could truly observe the counterfactual, then any difference in outcomes we observed could be fully attributed to the difference in the fact itself. This is how the counterfactual framework lays the foundation for the \u201cbuilding\u201d of causal inference.\n## Counterfactuals in epidemiology\nIn epidemiology, researchers conduct causal inference studies based on the counterfactual framework. This is reasonable: epidemiology\u2014and public health more broadly\u2014often studies the health effects of interventions. Under the counterfactual framework, we extend the contrast between an exposed group and an unexposed group into a more explicitly causal scale of counterfactual outcomes. At Harvard, we explain the counterfactual framework even more directly in two sentences:\n\n_the outcome had everyone been intervened_\nvs.\n_the outcome had no one been intervened_\n\nAlthough this does not mean our results necessarily have strong causal validity, applying the counterfactual framework helps us understand more clearly what our real question is. The counterfactual framework is also used in data science, social science, and political science. As for the historical \u201cwhat if\u201d discussions mentioned earlier, they are typically not adopted as research because they lack research value. Just as I mentioned in my earlier writing\u2014\u201cquestions first\u201d\u2014the value of causal inference comes from the value of the research question itself.\n\n## Simulating counterfactuals\nIn reality, we can neither observe different timelines nor travel to parallel universes, let alone create a clone of a person. In that case, how can we satisfy the counterfactual framework\u2019s requirement that \u201ceverything else stays the same\u201d?\n\nThe answer, of course, is that we can\u2019t\u2014so we cannot know an individual\u2019s counterfactual. But for population-based research, we can **approximate** causal inference by simulating counterfactuals, using two highly comparable populations. Of course, large sample sizes also improve precision, but for causal inference specifically, populations are a compromise. Even so, population-based causal inference still requires meeting three conditions:\n\n1. Exchangeability\n2. Consistency\n3. Positivity\n\nDiscussions of these three conditions have been an enduring theme in epidemiologic causal inference over the past several decades.\n\n<p style='text-align:center; opacity:.8; font-size:.95em;'>\n <em>Written by Peng Luo, Harvard T.H.
