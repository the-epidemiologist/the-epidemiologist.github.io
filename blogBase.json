Many people, especially late at night, can\u2019t help but wonder: if I had made a different choice in the past, what would my present look like?\n\n## Counterfactual reasoning\nIf there\u2019s a chance in the future, we could trace the idea of counterfactuals from philosophy all the way through the historical development of epidemiology. In this essay, however, we focus simply on the basic concept of counterfactual reasoning and how it is applied in epidemiology.\n\nThe term counterfactual isn\u2019t hard to understand. In general, it just refers to an alternative possibility to a given fact. These come as a pair: the fact and its counterfactual. From this concept, one key principle is obvious: **a counterfactual cannot be observed**. And that is essentially the whole point\u2014counterfactuals are not lofty; in fact, we often use them in everyday conversation. For example, many history enthusiasts discuss how history might have changed if a person in the past had not done a certain thing, which is a classic example.\n\nIn the example above, we can also see another feature of counterfactuals: within this framework, we compare **different possible outcomes of the same event**, while keeping everything else unchanged. If we could truly observe the counterfactual, then any difference in outcomes we observed could be fully attributed to the difference in the fact itself. This is how the counterfactual framework lays the foundation for the \u201cbuilding\u201d of causal inference.\n## Counterfactuals in epidemiology\nIn epidemiology, researchers conduct causal inference studies based on the counterfactual framework. This is reasonable: epidemiology\u2014and public health more broadly\u2014often studies the health effects of interventions. Under the counterfactual framework, we extend the contrast between an exposed group and an unexposed group into a more explicitly causal scale of counterfactual outcomes. At Harvard, we explain the counterfactual framework even more directly in two sentences:\n\n_the outcome had everyone been intervened_\nvs.\n_the outcome had no one been intervened_\n\nAlthough this does not mean our results necessarily have strong causal validity, applying the counterfactual framework helps us understand more clearly what our real question is. The counterfactual framework is also used in data science, social science, and political science. As for the historical \u201cwhat if\u201d discussions mentioned earlier, they are typically not adopted as research because they lack research value. Just as I mentioned in my earlier writing\u2014\u201cquestions first\u201d\u2014the value of causal inference comes from the value of the research question itself.\n\n## Simulating counterfactuals\nIn reality, we can neither observe different timelines nor travel to parallel universes, let alone create a clone of a person. In that case, how can we satisfy the counterfactual framework\u2019s requirement that \u201ceverything else stays the same\u201d?\n\nThe answer, of course, is that we can\u2019t\u2014so we cannot know an individual\u2019s counterfactual. But for population-based research, we can **approximate** causal inference by simulating counterfactuals, using two highly comparable populations. Of course, large sample sizes also improve precision, but for causal inference specifically, populations are a compromise. Even so, population-based causal inference still requires meeting three conditions:\n\n1. Exchangeability\n2. Consistency\n3. Positivity\n\nDiscussions of these three conditions have been an enduring theme in epidemiologic causal inference over the past several decades.\n\n<p style='text-align:center; opacity:.8; font-size:.95em;'>\n <em>Written by Peng Luo, Harvard T.H.

As a fan of DAG, I would still want to write an article for it to express my love for DAG on this Valentine's Day.\n\n## DAG\nDAG has a long history since the early 1900s, and has been used in mathematics, computer science, etc. In 1999, [Robins and Greenland](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/abstract/1999/01000/causal_diagrams_for_epidemiologic_research.8.aspx) introduced DAG to epidemiology as a tool to visualize biases for causal inference. Now, almost all the epidemiology programs educate the new generation about DAG.\n\nWhy do we care about DAG? The answer is already given in the previous paragraph. _Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent_.  Before introducing the DAG, we can only describe biases, though it is less efficient when the study is complicated. Drawing a DAG, we can understand all the biases easily and clearly.\n\n<div align='center'>\n  <img src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ad495ff-2ab6-41d5-88c0-2cdd4408608a' width='150' />\n  <br/>\n  <small>The quote is from Ludwig Wittgenstein</small>\n</div>\n\n## Properties \nI now demonstrate the properties of the DAG. \n\nIn DAG, there are two components: **nodes** and **edges**. The nodes are shown as letters in the DAG. In the epidemiology context, it represents an actual outcome, intervention, or just say all the variables you have. The edges are shown as the arrows, which represent a direct effect from node to node, which is also a causal relationship that we care about. Therefore, in DAG 1, we say A causes Y.\n\n<div align='center'>\n  <img src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8899eca-488f-41a3-9952-62bc445af4d1' width='200' />\n  <br/>\n  <small>DAG1</small>\n</div>\n\n**Acyclic** means there should be no cycle in the DAG. Therefore, the nodes cannot cause themselves. In epidemiology, it also provides the arrows with the property of temporality, that time flows through the arrow: only the nodes that happened prior can cause the nodes happened later.\n\n## Causation vs. Association\nDAG can show both causation and association. When the arrow exists between two nodes, the nodes are associated, while causation only follows the direction of the arrow. In DAG 1, we say A is associated with Y and Y is associated with A. However, Y doesn't cause A, but A causes Y.\n\nFurthermore, as long as the nodes are connected, whether or not directly connected, the association exists. DAG 2 shows a classic confounder DAG, in which A is associated with Y through L.\n\n<div align='center'>\n  <img src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb70327e-77fe-4bff-b45b-955a0dea9c7c' width='200' />\n  <br/>\n  <small>DAG2</small>\n</div>\n\n## D-separation\nIn epidemiology, the unnecessary association becomes a threat to causal inference. For example, in DAG 2, the relationship between A and Y is biased by the confounder L. Therefore, if we just run the analysis without handling L, the association we observe is biased and cannot indicate a causal estimate. How do we address the biases? In DAG, we **condition** on the node by putting a box outside the node. This box could be many things: stratification, restriction, adjustment, etc. Whatever methods we choose, it is all shown as a box on the node. \n\n<div align='center'>\n  <img src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e0fec32-6e05-4600-ad5d-797ade8d98fa' width='200' />\n  <br/>\n  <small>DAG2 after conditional on L</small>\n</div>\n\nThe box will block any association through the arrow; hence, A and Y are not associated through the confounder L. This status of independence has many names, but in DAG, we call it **d-separation**. \n\nIdeally, our goal is to make our exposure node and outcome node d-separated. Once, the association we find through analysis can be interpreted as a causal estimate.\n\n### collider\nThere is a special case in the DAG, called **collider**:\n\nDAG 3 shows a collider Y, when Y is caused by both A and U. There is no association between A and U. However, if Y is conditioned, the association path will be opened. \n\n<div align='center'>\n  <img src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a105fdc2-4bb4-4da4-9cf2-a513eed225c3' width='200' />\n  <br/>\n  <small>DAG3</small>\n</div>\n\nCollider can be both a tool and a threat to us. You may have noticed that the **instrumental variable** approach beautifully utilize collider to address unmeasured confounding. Meanwhile, the selection bias is a form of collider that we should be concerned about. \n\n### rules of d-separation\nTherefore, we conclude the four rules of d-separation:\n\n1. If there are no variables conditioned on, a path is blocked if and only if two arrowheads collide in the same variables\n2. Any path with a non-collider that has been conditioned on is blocked\n3. A collider that has been conditioned on is not blocked\n4. A collider that has a descendant conditioned on does not block a path\n\nDrawing the DAG and thinking of the rules of d-separation, we will be able to visualize the study and the next step.\n\n## Common DAGs\n\n### confounder DAG\n<div align='center'>\n  <img src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb70327e-77fe-4bff-b45b-955a0dea9c7c' width='200' />\n</div>\n\n### selection bias DAG\n<div align='center'>\n  <img src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf12de4b-9a67-48c6-9519-9b430eadce3f' width='200' />\n</div>\n\n### mediation DAG\n<div align='center'>\n  <img src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6719d0bf-ac04-45a2-ad22-0534a4278525' width='200' />\n</div>\n\n## Limitation\nYet, DAG, as a non-original concept from epidemiology, has some limitations in visualizing the study. For example, effect measure modification cannot be shown in a DAG, though there are articles discussing some potential representations. DAG also fails to represent bias related to the timeline, which requires further graph and verbal explanation. Aside from visualization, DAG is a subjective-knowledge-based graph where the arrows are more empirically based rather than a universal truth. From that, the importance of expert knowledge is crucial in epidemiology. We will need to prioritize the causal question and traditional study design. Then use advanced modern methods as a tool for causal inference.\n\n<p style='text-align:center; opacity:.8; font-size:.95em;'>\n <em>Written by Peng Luo, Harvard T.H.
